# Bidirectional Predictive Coding

Code for experiments with **Bidirectional Predictive Coding** (BPC) based on 
[Oliviers et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415) and 
[Xu et al. (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8082531). 
See also the [example notebook on BPC](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/examples/bidirectional_pc/).


## ðŸ’» Reproduce results
Inside a virtual environment, first install all the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To reproduce all the experiments, then run
```
python train_pcn.py
```
The results are plotted in `plot_results.ipynb`.
