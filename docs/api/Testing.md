# Testing

JPC provides a few convenience functions to test different types of PC network (PCN):

* [jpc.test_discriminative_pc()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Testing/#jpc.test_discriminative_pc) 
for test loss and accuracy of discriminative PCNs;
* [jpc.test_generative_pc()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Testing/#jpc.test_generative_pc) 
for accuracy and output predictions of generative PCNs; and
* [jpc.test_hpc()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Testing/#jpc.test_hpc) for accuracy
of all models (amortiser, generator, & hybrid) as well as output predictions.
