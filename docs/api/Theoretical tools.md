# Theoretical tools

JPC provides the following theoretical tools that can be used to study 
**deep linear networks** (DLNs) trained with PC: 

* [jpc.compute_linear_equilib_energy()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Theoretical%20tools/#jpc.compute_linear_equilib_energy) 
to compute the theoretical PC energy at the solution of the activities for DLNs;
* [jpc.compute_linear_activity_hessian()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Theoretical%20tools/#jpc.compute_linear_activity_hessian) 
to compute the theoretical Hessian of the energy with respect to the activities of DLNs; 
* [jpc.compute_linear_activity_solution()](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Theoretical%20tools/#jpc.compute_linear_activity_solution) 
to compute the analytical PC inference solution for DLNs.
