# Initialisation

JPC provides 3 ways of initialising the activities of a PC network: 

* [jpc.init_activities_with_ffwd()](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Initialisation/#jpc.init_activities_with_ffwd) for a feedforward pass (standard), 
* [jpc.init_activities_from_normal()](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Initialisation/#jpc.init_activities_from_normal) for random initialisation, and 
* [jpc.init_activities_with_amort()](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Initialisation/#jpc.init_activities_with_amort) for use of an amortised network.
